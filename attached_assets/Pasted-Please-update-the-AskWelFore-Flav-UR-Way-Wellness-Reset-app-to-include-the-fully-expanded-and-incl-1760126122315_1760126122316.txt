Please update the AskWelFore / Flav.UR.Way Wellness Reset app to include the fully expanded and inclusive Step 4: Cuisines & Cultural Comforts section below.

🔹 Goal: Replace the current Step 4 fieldset in quiz.html (or plan.html, depending on which controls the quiz interface) with the HTML block provided below.
🔹 Maintain all existing logic:

Form data should still post to cuisines[] and cuisines_other.

Validation, navigation, and progress tracking must remain functional.

Autofill from GHL (name, email, phone) must remain unchanged.

🔹 UI Requirements:

Use the .cuisine-table and .cuisine-column structure for responsive two-column layout.

Ensure proper scroll behavior and alignment on mobile.

Keep existing typography and styling from styles.css.

When the “Other” checkbox is selected, display the text input field below it (id="otherCuisineText").

Confirm that all 8 major cuisine categories render:

American Regional Traditions 🇺🇸

Indigenous & Native Traditions 🪶

African Diaspora 🌍

Caribbean 🏝️ (including U.S. Virgin Islands 🇻🇮)

Latin American 🌮

Asian & Middle Eastern 🍜

European & Mediterranean 🧀

Fusion / Other 🌀

🔹 Accessibility & Aesthetics:

Preserve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

Ensure headings and checkboxes maintain readable contrast.

Footer note should read:
“Your region and culture tell your flavor story — we’ll use them to make healthy taste like home.”

🔹 Validation:

Keep Step 4 mandatory (user must select at least one cuisine before continuing).

“Other” text field is optional but must only appear when its checkbox is checked.

After implementing, please:

Verify that the app runs without console or CSS errors.

Confirm that Step 4 now displays all eight global categories and that the “Other” field functions dynamically.

Test full 6-step navigation, ensuring that selections persist and submit properly.

Keep progress tracker text (“Step 4 of 6”) visible and consistent in style with Steps 1–6.

Here is the complete HTML block to insert:

Once complete, please confirm that Step 4 renders correctly across desktop and mobile, and that all cuisine groups and territories (including Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Virgin Islands) appear as selectable options.
