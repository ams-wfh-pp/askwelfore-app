🧠 Final Replit Agent Prompt — Flav.UR.Way Wellness Reset App (AskWelFore)

Goal:
Complete and republish the Flav.UR.Way Wellness Reset app with the final feature set, inclusive of the Eat-the-Rainbow framework, cultural cuisine expansion, GHL autofill logic, and multi-ethnic visuals.
Important: Do not overwrite the last working backend (main.py). Only update the front-end templates, styling, and light JS interactivity.

✅ 1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Keep the app fully operational on FastAPI with no changes to routes or field names expected by main.py.

Maintain sequential step logic and progress bar (“Step X of 6”).

Preserve backend form field compatibility for:
red_foods, orange_foods, yellow_foods, green_foods, purple_foods, white_foods, their _other variants, dietary_restrictions, cuisines, cuisines_other, lifestyle (with new keys), and plan_duration.

Ensure gentle validations (no hard errors).

Keep the award/trust ribbons and motivational copy visible across all steps.

🌈 2. STEP-BY-STEP UPDATES
Step 1 — About You

✅ Already perfect.
✅ Keep breastfeeding logic intact.
✅ Add the autofill script (see section 6) just after <body> opens.

Step 2 — Eat the Rainbow

Replace existing Step-2 fieldset with the upgraded version below:

Each color group displays:

Multiple checkbox options (from food_options dict).

“Other favorites (comma-separated)” text field beneath each color.

Live per-color count (“Selected X”).

At least one food selection across all colors is mandatory before progressing.

Add encouraging microcopy:

“Aim for all six colors daily — each one adds its own nutrients and healing power!”

Include a total count summary:
“You’ve picked X items across the rainbow so far!”

Step 3 — Health Goals & Dietary Preferences

Replace dietary restriction input with multi-select checkboxes:

Gluten-free  
Dairy-free  
Nut-free  
Shellfish-free  
Vegetarian  
Vegan  
Halal  
Kosher  
Fasting (intermittent/religious)  
Other → [text box]


All selections map to the existing dietary_restrictions list.

Add an optional text area:
“What does feeling your best look like to you?”

Step 4 — Cuisines & Cultural Comforts (Expanded)

Replace the current cuisine fieldset with the full multi-region version below (group headings included for visual clarity):

🌀 Other or Fusion Influences

Checkbox: “Other”

Text field: “Tell us about other food traditions, regions, or dishes that inspire you.”

Include guiding copy:

“We use this to celebrate your food roots — no cuisine is ever off the table here.”

Keep backend consistency with cuisines + cuisines_other.

Step 5 — Lifestyle & Habits

Enhance with more human, engaging tone and multi-ethnic emoji diversity.

Activity Level (replace emojis):

🧍🏽‍♂️ Sedentary – mostly sitting  
🏃🏾‍♀️ Lightly Active – light exercise 1–3 days/week  
🧘🏽‍♀️ Moderately Active – movement 3–5 days/week  
🏋🏿‍♂️ Very Active – intense exercise 6–7 days/week  


New Fields to Add:

Snacking Frequency:
“How often do you snack between meals?”

Rarely (I’m good until meals)

Occasionally (1–2 times/day)

Frequently (3+ times/day)

Constant grazer 😄

Kitchen Tools (multi-select):
Stove
Oven
Microwave
Air Fryer
Blender / Food Processor
Refrigerator / Freezer

Family Size: (numeric input, default 1)

Keep consistent with backend field family_size.

All new values should save under lifestyle (keys: snacking, kitchen_tools).

Step 6 — Choose Your Plan

No structural changes; only update text for brand consistency:

Rename to: “Personalize Your Flav.UR.Way Wellness Blueprint”

Keep free vs. premium logic intact.

Use trust badge:
“Recognized globally for innovation in Wellness & Prevention — Digital Health Hub Finalist 2025.”

🎨 3. MULTI-ETHNIC ICONS

Replace all existing single-tone emojis in Step 5 and any person icons throughout with multi-skin-tone versions (neutral to medium tones).
Ensure they render as standard Unicode and not SVG assets.

🔄 4. VALIDATION & UX ENHANCEMENTS

Each step must validate required fields before advancing, using friendly in-page reminders.

Show progress text “Step X of 6” + progress bar.

Keep “Next” and “Back” buttons consistent (rounded gradient buttons).

🔗 5. TRUST RIBBON (Global)

At bottom of each step, include:

🏅 Backed by 10+ years of research and real-world results — including an ADA-funded clinical study with Eastern Virginia Medical School.

Final step (Step 6) changes to:

🌿 Recognized globally for innovation in Wellness & Prevention — Digital Health Hub Finalist 2025.

⚙️ 6. GHL INTEGRATION — AUTO-FILL LOGIC

Add this JS snippet right after the <body> tag in the Step 1 template:

<script>
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  if (params.get('first_name')) document.getElementById('name').value = params.get('first_name');
  if (params.get('email')) {
    const emailField = document.getElementById('email');
    if (emailField) emailField.value = params.get('email');
  }
  if (params.get('phone')) {
    const phoneField = document.getElementById('phone');
    if (phoneField) phoneField.value = params.get('phone');
  }
</script>


This ensures users coming from GoHighLevel links like:

https://27089137-8697-4689-b36d-8a602157fef1-00-113e2z1dz8j0x.riker.replit.dev/plan?first_name={{contact.first_name}}&email={{contact.email}}&phone={{contact.phone}}


have their Step 1 fields pre-filled automatically.

🧾 7. VALIDATION CHECKS BEFORE REPUBLISHING

Before you push live:

Test each step transition (Step 1 → 6).

Confirm rainbow foods validate correctly.

Verify multiple dietary restrictions map to backend list.

Confirm cuisine list displays full expanded version.

Ensure GHL auto-fill works via URL query.

Run one 3-day and one 7-day plan generation test.

Ensure /plan renders correctly post-submission with meal plan summary, color tracking, and PDFs.

🌐 8. REPUBLISH IN LIVE MODE

After applying all above updates:

Re-enable full Replit run environment.

Confirm that Nix build completes successfully.

Publish app at the live endpoint:
https://askwelfore-app.replit.app
