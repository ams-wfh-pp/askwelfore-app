🧠 Replit Agent — Final Enhancement Brief for AskWelFore / Flav.UR.Way Wellness Reset
🔧 Objective

Refine the 6-step AskWelFore Wellness Reset quiz to align fully with the Eat-the-Rainbow + Flavor-First model.
Maintain all backend data compatibility with main.py (no breaking field names), but update quiz.html / plan.html templates to reflect the new UX, logic, and interactivity.

✅ GLOBAL UPDATES

Progress Tracker

Show “Step X of 6” prominently at top (already works fine).

Keep motivational sub-line:
“You’re building your Flavor-First Wellness Blueprint!”

Trust Ribbon

Add persistent ribbon at bottom of every step (per previous spec).
🏅 “Backed by 10+ years of research and real-world results — including an ADA-funded clinical study with Eastern Virginia Medical School.”

Step 6 (final) can instead display:
🌿 “Recognized globally for innovation in Wellness & Prevention — Digital Health Hub Finalist 2025.”

Validation

Make color selections (Step 2) mandatory: at least one item chosen across all colors.

Use gentle, friendly alerts (no harsh modals).

🌈 STEP 2 — Eat the Rainbow (REQUIRED FIX)

Goal: Users select favorites within each color group, not just the color itself.

Show sections for each color with:

Multi-select checkboxes for suggested foods.

A text field labeled “Other favorites (comma-separated)” per color.

Live color counter (“Selected X”).

Require at least one food selected total before continuing.

Maintain backend field names:

red_foods, red_foods_other, orange_foods, etc.

Add friendly prompt beneath:

“Aim for all six colors daily — each one adds its own nutrients and healing power!”

💪 STEP 3 — Wellness Goals & Dietary Preferences

Enhancements:

Allow multiple dietary restrictions via checkboxes:

Gluten-free

Dairy-free

Nut-free

Shellfish-free

Vegetarian

Vegan

Halal

Kosher

Fasting (intermittent / religious)

Other → text input

Keep “Primary health goal” as single-select dropdown.

Optional text: “What does feeling your best look like to you?”

Add logic to map new restriction array into the existing backend field dietary_restrictions (string list accepted by main.py).

🍽️ STEP 4 — Cuisines, Culture & Comfort

Enhancements:

Keep Americas / Africa / Asia–Middle East–Europe groupings.

Add final category labeled “Other or Fusion Influences”
with open text box:

“Tell us about other food traditions, regions, or dishes that inspire you.”

Ensure “Other” checkbox reveals this input when selected.

Maintain cuisines + cuisines_other consistency for backend.

🏡 STEP 5 — Lifestyle & Habits

Tone: friendly, practical, self-discovery.
Additions:

Add Snacking Behavior question:

“How often do you snack between meals?”

Options:

Rarely (I’m good until meals)

Occasionally (1-2 times/day)

Frequently (3+ times/day)

Constant grazer 😄

Add Kitchen Access / Tools question:

“Which tools do you have at home?” (multi-select)

Stove

Oven

Microwave

Air Fryer

Blender / Food Processor

Refrigerator / Freezer

Add Food Access question (already partially in main.py) — keep options for “Good / Limited / Poor access”.

Add Family Size field if not already visible here.

Optional: Weekly Grocery Budget (keep existing dropdown).

🚀 STEP 6 — Choose Your Plan

Keep current design and pricing layout.

Ensure all language uses “Flav.UR.Way Wellness Blueprint”.

Optional upsell logic remains non-subscription (single purchase mode).

⚙️ Backend Integration Notes

Ensure main.py still receives:

rainbow_preferences dict

health_goals list

dietary_restrictions list

cuisines list + cuisines_other string

lifestyle dict updated with new keys:

snacking, kitchen_tools

Validation: if user skips color or cuisine questions → friendly inline reminder.

🧾 Deliverables

Updated plan.html (or quiz.html) with all enhanced steps.

Minor JS for validation + “Other” field toggles.

Light CSS refinements:

.color-count, .trust-ribbon, .fieldset-description spacing.

Pill-style checkboxes for colors + cuisines.

Confirm end-to-end data submission through FastAPI routes (no field loss).
