🧠 Comprehensive Replit Agent Prompt — “AskWelFore Wellness Reset” UX & Logic Enhancement
GOAL

Upgrade the current 6-step AskWelFore Wellness Reset quiz to make it:

✨ Emotionally engaging and personal

🌈 Faithful to the Eat-the-Rainbow + Family-Centered logic

🏠 Inclusive of access, culture, and lifestyle context

📊 Fully structured and backend-ready (no breaking main.py compatibility)

1️⃣ Overall UX Enhancements

Add a progress tracker (e.g. “Step 2 of 6”) above the purple progress bar on every page.

Use conversational microcopy — warm, human, empowering tone.

Add subtle emojis to legends and headers (like existing “🌈”, “💬”, etc.).

Show subtle motivational text (“You’re almost there!”) on the last two steps.

2️⃣ Step 1 – About You

Keep: name, age, gender, family size, breastfeeding.
Add:

✅ Question: “Who do you usually cook or eat with?” (single select)

Myself only

Partner or spouse

Kids or family

Roommates or friends

✅ Make name, age, gender, and activity level mandatory.

✅ Retain the breastfeeding toggle logic (only shown if gender = female).

3️⃣ Step 2 – Rainbow Food Preferences

Replace the current step with this logic:

✅ One “color group” at a time with checkboxes + text field (Other (comma-separated)).

✅ Include a short header at top:
“Eating the rainbow means filling your plate with color and variety. Choose your favorite foods in each group!”

✅ Keep your food_options dictionary structure unchanged.

✅ Add “You’ve selected X of 6 colors!” at bottom, updated dynamically.

✅ Mark as required to select at least one color group before moving on.

4️⃣ Step 3 – Health Goals & Restrictions

Add warmth + definitions:

Each health goal checkbox should have a friendly tooltip or small subtext, e.g.

Heart Health → “Lower sodium, more fiber, healthy fats.”

GLP-1 Support → “If you’re on Ozempic or Mounjaro, we tailor portions and protein.”

Add a short question:
“What does feeling your best look like to you?” (short text answer, optional).

5️⃣ Step 4 – Cuisines, Culture & Comfort

Use the engaging, dynamic version we finalized earlier (the one with storytelling textarea + “Other” reveal).
Add under the textarea:

“If you could reinvent a favorite family dish to be lighter or salt-free, which one would it be?”
Include this as a new text field: reinvent_dish.

6️⃣ Step 5 – Lifestyle & Habits (Major Overhaul)

Make this step feel like a conversation — not a census.

Add these questions:

“What does a typical weekday look like for you?” (dropdown)

Mostly seated or at a desk

On your feet most of the day

Physically active job or outdoor work

Constantly on the go / caring for others

“How would you describe your energy levels most days?”

Low 😴

Okay ⚖️

High ⚡

“Do you have access to these cooking tools?” (multi-select)

Stove

Oven

Microwave

Air fryer

Blender

None of the above

“How often do you have access to fresh produce or groceries?”

Always — I live near stores/farmers markets

Sometimes — limited selection nearby

Rarely — it’s hard to find or afford fresh foods (flag = food desert)

“What’s your typical weekly food budget?”

<$50 /week

$50-100

$100-150

$150

“How many meals do you usually eat each day?” (1-4, dropdown)

“What’s your biggest challenge with healthy eating?” (text)

✅ Make required: activity level, access to fresh foods, family size, and food budget.

Activity Level → use this refined copy for clarity:

Sedentary 🪑 – Mostly sitting or desk work

Lightly Active 🚶 – Light exercise 1-3 days/week or active around the house

Moderately Active 🏃 – Exercise 3-5 days/week, regular movement

Very Active 💪 – Daily intense workouts or physical labor

7️⃣ Step 6 – Choose Your Plan

Keep the existing “fun” cards, but revise pricing logic as one-time purchases, not subscriptions.

Replace pricing copy with:

🎁 Free 3-Day Starter Plan — Perfect for trying the FlavURWay!

💚 7-Day Wellness Plan — Includes complete menu + grocery list — $14.95

🌟 14-Day Deep Reset — Includes full color analysis + bonus Flavor Reset Guide — $24.95

✅ When selected, the corresponding value (plan_duration) still passes correctly to main.py.
✅ Rename the CTA button to: “See My Personalized Plan 🌈”

8️⃣ Accessibility & Flow

Ensure all “Next” buttons validate required fields.

Allow “Back” navigation to re-edit previous steps.

Keep global error handling (no crash if form incomplete).

9️⃣ Optional Styling / Feedback

Add a small footer text below progress bar:

“You’re building your Flavor-First Wellness Blueprint!”

Use soft transitions between steps (fade/slide).

Add a friendly success message on submit:

“✨ Great job! Your personalized plan is generating...”

✅ FILES AFFECTED

/templates/plan.html — full update for steps 1-6 per this specification.

/static/styles.css — add step progress counter and new color-group feedback styles.

/main.py — no structural change needed, only verify that new form field names match current Form() definitions (add reinvent_dish, flavor_story, food_access, and appliances if missing).

📋 Acceptance Criteria

Sequential 6-step quiz with conversational tone and “Step X of 6” visible.

Responsive, mobile-friendly UI.

Mandatory logic works correctly.

All form data posts cleanly to main.py and displays in plan summary.
