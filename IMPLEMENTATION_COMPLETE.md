## 🔍 How Crash Resistance Works

1. **Startup Safety Check**:
   ```
   ⚠️ Warning: Missing packages detected: requests, multipart
   ⚠️ Form submission endpoint will be disabled until python-multipart is installed
   ⚠️ GHL integration and email features will be disabled until requests is installed
   ✅ Safety patch loaded successfully
   ```

2. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Missing `python-multipart`? → Homepage shows setup instructions
   - Missing `requests`? → Webhook returns helpful 503 error
   - Missing both? → App still runs, serves static content

3. **Global Exception Handler**:
   - Catches ALL unhandled exceptions
   - Returns proper JSON error responses
   - Logs errors for debugging
   - Never crashes the server
