enhanced brand copy for all six steps, written in your signature WelFore voice:
warm, empowering, inclusive, and flavor-first.

🟣 Step 1 — Tell Us About You

Headline:
👋 Let’s Get to Know You

Description:
We believe wellness starts with understanding you — your family, your lifestyle, and your goals.
Tell us a little about who’s around your table and how you live day to day.
Every answer helps us tailor a plan that fits your real life, not someone else’s.

Tone cues: curious, personal, conversational
Optional sub-prompt: “Who do you usually cook or eat with? Food tastes better when shared.”

🌈 Step 2 — Eat the Rainbow

Headline:
🌈 What Colors Brighten Your Plate?

Description:
Eating the rainbow means celebrating variety — the reds, greens, oranges, and purples that fuel your body and your joy.
Choose the fruits and veggies you love most from each color group.
If something’s missing, tell us! We’ll weave your favorites into your flavor plan.

Encouragement footer:
“Each color brings its own nutrients and healing power — aim for all six daily!”

💪 Step 3 — Your Wellness Goals

Headline:
💪 What Does “Feeling Your Best” Mean to You?

Description:
Wellness looks different for everyone. Some want more energy, others need balance or recovery.
Select the health goals that matter most to you, and we’ll build your plan around them —
whether it’s supporting your heart, balancing blood sugar, or keeping your glow strong.

Encouragement footer:
“Your goals guide your plate — every bite should move you closer to feeling amazing.”

🍽️ Step 4 — Cuisines, Culture & Comfort

Headline:
🍽️ What Flavors Feel Like Home?

Description:
Food is more than fuel — it’s family, memory, and identity.
Select the cuisines that bring you joy or reflect your heritage.
Then share a story about a dish that means something to you — the comfort food you crave,
the celebration meal that brings everyone together, or the flavor that makes you smile.

Encouragement footer:
“Your culture isn’t a restriction — it’s the flavor foundation of your wellness journey.”

🏡 Step 5 — Lifestyle & Habits

Headline:
🏡 Let’s Make It Work for Your Life

Description:
Healthy living isn’t one-size-fits-all — it’s about meeting you where you are.
Tell us how you move, cook, shop, and manage your day.
We’ll design a realistic plan that fits your time, budget, and kitchen setup —
because flavor and balance should never depend on perfect conditions.

Encouragement footer:
“Your plan should flex around your life — not the other way around.”

🚀 Step 6 — Choose Your Plan

Headline:
🚀 You’re Almost There!

Description:
You’ve personalized your FlavURWay Wellness Blueprint — now let’s unlock your plan.
Start with a free 3-day taste test or go all in for 7 or 14 days of recipes, shopping lists,
and practical flavor coaching.

Encouragement footer:
“Great job! You’ve built something that’s as unique as you are. Let’s bring your flavor-first reset to life.”

💡 Optional Closing Microcopy (after submission)

Message while generating plan:
✨ “Your flavor-first meal plan is being prepared! We’re mixing colors, goals, and heritage to design something that’s authentically you…”

Success confirmation:
✅ “All set! Your personalized plan is ready. Get ready to eat boldly, live balanced, and love your plate again.”

Would you like me to add a “trust + credibility ribbon” (e.g.,

“Backed by 10+ years of research and an ADA-funded clinical study”)
to appear subtly on every step’s footer or only on the final screen?

You said:
that would be nice
ChatGPT said:

Beautiful — that’s exactly the kind of quiet authority that makes the experience feel credible and reassuring without breaking the warm, conversational tone.

Here’s the recommended trust ribbon implementation and copy styling for your Replit agent to include 👇

🏅 Trust & Credibility Ribbon — Implementation Notes
🎯 Purpose:

Subtle, ever-present reassurance that this isn’t just another diet quiz —
it’s a science-backed, culturally grounded system with real results.

💬 Suggested Placement:

Fixed footer banner (centered, 90% width) that gently fades in at the bottom of every step.

Light gray text, small font (0.85em), italicized for warmth.

Optional mini “🏅” or “🔬” emoji for credibility with personality.

🧩 Copy Options:
Option A (Full Statement – for desktop/tablet):

🏅 Backed by 10+ years of research and real-world results — including an ADA-funded clinical study with Eastern Virginia Medical School.

Option B (Condensed – for mobile):

🔬 Clinically evaluated & trusted by 500,000+ families.

Option C (Final Step / Results Page Emphasis):

🌿 The FlavURWay System — Recognized globally for innovation in Wellness & Prevention (Digital Health Hub Finalist, 2025).

🎨 Styling Notes for CSS:
.trust-ribbon {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 0.85em;
  color: #4a5568;
  font-style: italic;
  margin-top: 30px;
  opacity: 0.9;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.trust-ribbon:hover {
  opacity: 1;
  color: #2d3748;
}

✅ Integration Guidance for Replit Agent:

Add this <div class="trust-ribbon"> element below the navigation buttons on every step (inside each template block).

Swap the copy dynamically:

Steps 1–5 → use Option A or B depending on screen size.

Step 6 (final screen) → use Option C for recognition / credibility closeout.
